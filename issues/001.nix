      <p>Did you know you can let Nix daemon handle garbage collection automatically? This can be done by setting the variable <code>min-free</code> to trigger a garbage collection if the remaining disk is less than its value in bytes each time Nix is manipulating the store.
      However, you may also want to set <code>max-free</code> in order to prevent the garbage collector to removing too much content from the store, this value tells Nix to stop the garbage collector once a certain amount of space is available.</p>
      <p>Using the following code, you can tell Nix to automatically handle the free space when you have less than 1 GB until you have 3 GB available.
      <pre>nix.extraOptions = '''
        min-free = 1073741824
        max-free = 3221225472
      ''';</pre></p>

      <p>I'm pleased to announce the release of the first issue of this Webzine. I made a similar experiment with the OpenBSD webzine and it turned out it worked well, so why not do it for NixOS?</p>
      <p>The website is made of static HTML files generated entirely from a nix expression, it's super fun to add entries in it, and only have a few dependencies, feel free to contribute ðŸ¤˜</p>
