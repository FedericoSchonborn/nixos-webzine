      <p>When looking for NixOS modules options, if they exist or how to use them, you always have these information at hand in a manual page named <code>configuration.nix</code>.</p>
      <p>If you are not familiar with manual pages (often referred to as "man pages"), just type <code>man configuration.nix</code> in a terminal, and scroll around. By default, the program <code>less</code> is used to display the manual page content, it's call a pager.
      For searching, use <code>/some_pattern</code>, you can repeat a search with <code>n</code> (Vi users should feel at home)</p>
